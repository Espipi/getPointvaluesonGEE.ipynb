# Extract pixel values in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for Fluxnet sites

Both Fluxnet and Google Earth Engine (GEE) are planetary-scale platforms for scientific research. Data from these two platforms provide an unprecedented perspective that allows researchers to detect the trends in climate and global change. However, I found it is a little tricky to get remote sensing values from GEE for Fluxnet sites. 

  The official guide of GEE is written by Javascript, though Python API is also provided, it is hard to find related tutorials. For scientists in the Fluxnet community who want to use rich remote sensing datasets on GEE but not familiar with Javascript, I wrote a small piece of python code for extracting pixel values in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for Fluxnet sites. I know there are also excellent third-party GEE packages that can tackle this task too but under the "simple and easy to use" principle, I think this code will be the fastest solution. Written by Python, this code can be easily combined with the Fluxnet dataset, and then you can make full use of python's data mining capabilities.

  Hope this little thing is helpful to you and happy coding :). You can contact me or xutr@bnu.edu.cn if you have any questions about the code.
